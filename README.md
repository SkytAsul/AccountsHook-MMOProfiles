# AccountsHook-MMOProfiles

This is a plugin that bridges [MMOProfiles](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/109942) profiles into the [AccountsHook](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/59491) open API.

> [!important]
> Starting with version 1.2 build 61, MMOProfiles is directly integrating with AccountsHook, **rendering this plugin useless**.  
> This repository is therefore a read-only archive.
